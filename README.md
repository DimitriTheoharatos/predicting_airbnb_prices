# predicting_airbnb_prices

In this project, I scrape hundreds of Airbnb listings, extracting several features of interest in order to predict the optimal
price to set an Airbnb listing using linear regression and regularization. 

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


### Files

`Scraping and Feature Engineering.ipynb` --> This notebook covers the web scraping methodology and data cleaning process.  

`EDA.ipynb` --> Covers exploratory analysis of our features of interest.  Visualizations are used to convey significant relationships. 

`Modeling.ipynb` --> Contains the bulk of the modeling and algorithmic analysis. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run the following command:


```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
